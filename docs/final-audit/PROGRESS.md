# Fawri final audit — resume here

Updated: 2026-10-10
Status: **FA-000 PASS; FA-001 IN PROGRESS**.
Main baseline at last verified merge: `a083262e68557ec6838799da5a869e90b909b56f` (PR #478).

## Completed
- FA-000 continuity ledger: PR #477 squash-merged as `3b51731758ff3e15728bdb61bafb4149976f6882`.
- FA-001 enumeration: 225 branches across GitHub pages 100 + 100 + 25; inventory documented by merged PR #478.
- Priority comparisons: independent cashier licensing branch is 0 ahead/44 behind; FastPay readiness branch 0 ahead/36 behind.
- Old cashier entitlement branch is 3 ahead/179 behind. Its `0027_cashier_subscription_entitlement.sql` is an **obsolete/incompatible design**, not an appropriate direct merge: current main has `0027_cashier_subscription_licensing.sql` and a broader cashier subscription schema. Database migration execution remains unverified.
- `fix/cashier-first-station`: 1 ahead/177 behind, 4 changed paths; main already contains `cashierStationCreation.ts`. Patch equivalence not yet proven.
- `fix/admin-retired-subscription-migration`: 2 ahead/6 behind; requires review.
- Draft PR #476 `fix/staging-admin-ui-qa`: 4 ahead/2 behind, 7 files; author says build/typecheck passed but visual QA pending. Do not merge until verified.
- `feature/whatsapp-offline-foundation`: 240 ahead/3233 behind, 93 changed files; high-risk legacy branch, do not merge blindly.
- `docs/staging-ui-findings`: 1 ahead/2 behind, contains the 2026-10-09 admin UI findings; not on main at same path.

## Next exact action
1. Continue read-only comparison of remaining branches; classify using content equivalence as well as ahead/behind (squash merges change ancestry).
2. Review PR #476 against the three staging UI findings; run or inspect CI and real visual QA before any merge.
3. Verify current cashier migrations/schema against live Neon PostgreSQL in FA-004; absence of legacy file is not a defect.
4. Record further evidence and update this ledger via a PR. Never modify protected main directly.

## Restrictions
No unapproved application code changes, branch deletion, database changes, secret exposure or production deployment. Do not repeat historical 16 core phases without a scoped reason.

## 2026-10-10 staging verification addendum
- Railway `fawri-staging/fawri-web` deployment status SUCCESS; user supplied `/ops/readiness` response with `ready`, `postgresql_authority: up`, and `production_release_configuration: up` at `2026-10-10T18:17:58.935Z`.
- User confirmed `FAWRI_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=staging`, `FAWRI_EXPECTED_POSTGRES_RUNTIME_ROLE=fawri_staging_rls_runtime`. The readiness code compares `current_user` with the expected role; it does not switch roles itself. No secret values recorded.
- Neon `staging-runtime` branch `br-falling-dust-b1km4gix`: 94 public tables, 28 Drizzle migration records, 1 merchant, 0 Meta channels; 45 RLS-enabled and 49 without RLS. Restricted role has no BYPASSRLS but broad grants to selected non-RLS auth/cashier tables. Default Neon `production` branch is distinct and missing the migration ledger.
- Open: FA-I-006 Meta page routing under RLS; FA-I-007 sensitive non-RLS table grants and application authorization; FA-I-008 branch targeting; FA-I-009 scope of readiness proof. No live data mutation, branch merge, production deploy, or credential changes.
- Next: inspect targeted API authorization paths and run negative tenant isolation / Meta mapping tests on a disposable local database. Do not declare FA-004 PASS from readiness alone.
