# Fawri final audit — resume here

Updated: 2026-10-10
Status: **FA-000 PASS; FA-001 IN PROGRESS**.
Main baseline at last verified merge: `a083262e68557ec6838799da5a869e90b909b56f` (PR #478).

## Completed
- FA-000 continuity ledger: PR #477 squash-merged as `3b51731758ff3e15728bdb61bafb4149976f6882`.
- FA-001 enumeration: 225 branches across GitHub pages 100 + 100 + 25; inventory documented by merged PR #478.
- Priority comparisons: independent cashier licensing branch is 0 ahead/44 behind; FastPay readiness branch 0 ahead/36 behind.
- Old cashier entitlement branch is 3 ahead/179 behind. Its `0027_cashier_subscription_entitlement.sql` is an **obsolete/incompatible design**, not an appropriate direct merge: current main has `0027_cashier_subscription_licensing.sql` and a broader cashier subscription schema. Database migration execution remains unverified.
- `fix/cashier-first-station`: 1 ahead/177 behind, 4 changed paths; main already contains `cashierStationCreation.ts`. Patch equivalence not yet proven.
- `fix/admin-retired-subscription-migration`: 2 ahead/6 behind; requires review.
- Draft PR #476 `fix/staging-admin-ui-qa`: 4 ahead/2 behind, 7 files; author says build/typecheck passed but visual QA pending. Do not merge until verified.
- `feature/whatsapp-offline-foundation`: 240 ahead/3233 behind, 93 changed files; high-risk legacy branch, do not merge blindly.
- `docs/staging-ui-findings`: 1 ahead/2 behind, contains the 2026-10-09 admin UI findings; not on main at same path.

## Next exact action
1. Continue read-only comparison of remaining branches; classify using content equivalence as well as ahead/behind (squash merges change ancestry).
2. Review PR #476 against the three staging UI findings; run or inspect CI and real visual QA before any merge.
3. Verify current cashier migrations/schema against live Neon PostgreSQL in FA-004; absence of legacy file is not a defect.
4. Record further evidence and update this ledger via a PR. Never modify protected main directly.

## Restrictions
No unapproved application code changes, branch deletion, database changes, secret exposure or production deployment. Do not repeat historical 16 core phases without a scoped reason.

## 2026-10-10 staging verification addendum
- Railway `fawri-staging/fawri-web` deployment status SUCCESS; user supplied `/ops/readiness` response with `ready`, `postgresql_authority: up`, and `production_release_configuration: up` at `2026-10-10T18:17:58.935Z`.
- User confirmed `FAWRI_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=staging`, `FAWRI_EXPECTED_POSTGRES_RUNTIME_ROLE=fawri_staging_rls_runtime`. The readiness code compares `current_user` with the expected role; it does not switch roles itself. No secret values recorded.
- Neon `staging-runtime` branch `br-falling-dust-b1km4gix`: 94 public tables, 28 Drizzle migration records, 1 merchant, 0 Meta channels; 45 RLS-enabled and 49 without RLS. Restricted role has no BYPASSRLS but broad grants to selected non-RLS auth/cashier tables. Default Neon `production` branch is distinct and missing the migration ledger.
- Open: FA-I-006 Meta page routing under RLS; FA-I-007 sensitive non-RLS table grants and application authorization; FA-I-008 branch targeting; FA-I-009 scope of readiness proof. No live data mutation, branch merge, production deploy, or credential changes.
- Next: inspect targeted API authorization paths and run negative tenant isolation / Meta mapping tests on a disposable local database. Do not declare FA-004 PASS from readiness alone.

## FA-I-006 follow-up: source review (2026-10-10)
- The Meta webhook middleware reads the page-to-merchant directory before merchant operational authorization. An unresolved page returns HTTP 503.
- PostgreSQL-only mode uses the channel mapping authority; its all-pages query has no tenant context.
- Migrations 0024 and 0025 establish a tenant-or-audited-admin RLS predicate for merchant_channels.
- The existing Meta ingress integration test is restricted to local fawri_ci and does not prove staging restricted-role behavior.
- Next: reproduce with a synthetic connected page and a restricted role on disposable PostgreSQL. Do not alter live Neon or bypass RLS.

## FA-I-006 reproduction matrix and scope (2026-10-10)
Source verified: `merchantWebhookAccess.ts`, `metaPageDirectory.ts`, `postgresMetaChannelAuthority.ts`, `operationalPostgresAuthority.ts`, `meta-webhook-postgres-ingress-cutover.integration.test.ts`.

Required disposable-PostgreSQL cases (not executed yet):
1. Connected page A for approved merchant A under restricted NOBYPASSRLS role, no tenant/admin context: verify whether `listActiveMetaPageMappingsAuthoritative()` returns page A and middleware calls next. Record actual `current_user` and RLS policy state.
2. Same fixture with tenant context A inside transaction: verify page A visible and merchant B page invisible; reset context on pooled connection.
3. Unknown page: expect HTTP 503 `META_PAGE_DIRECTORY_UNAVAILABLE` (current contract); ensure no merchant data is leaked.
4. Suspended merchant with known page: ensure terminal event handling without enqueue, as current local-only ingress test expects.
5. Batch with one valid and one unknown page: inspect all-or-nothing 503 and webhook retry/idempotency consequences; do not label a defect without an expected-contract decision.
6. Prove no tenant bypass or unrestricted global page-directory grants are introduced by any fix.

Execution blocker: no verified disposable local PostgreSQL runtime attached to this audit session. The existing local-only integration test does not switch to a restricted role. Do not run its mutating fixtures on Neon staging. This is an OPEN_PROOF, not PASS or confirmed production failure.

Audit completion tracking: planning estimate 30/100 overall, unchanged; do not increment until an actual restricted-role test or another closure criterion is evidenced.

## 2026-10-11 audit continuation — current resume checkpoint
- Source of truth is current GitHub `main`; PRs #477-#512 include a series of docs-only audit register merges. #511 was superseded by conflict-free #512, squash merged as `c43fd488ba8386d5b8b4367d30253393e9131651`. Docs PR #510 merged as `6d805640ef27da3ba2acc441830f05ea1ede6e9b`. No application code changes or runtime test executions were made in these audit PRs.
- Current conversational planning estimate: **54/100 overall audit coverage**, not test coverage or launch readiness. Historical 30/100 in earlier section is superseded for this checkpoint, but remains preserved as history. Estimate is qualitative; do not count a docs merge as new tested functionality.
- Railway staging project `fawri-staging`, service `fawri-web`: read-only environment status showed online, one running replica, zero recent deployment failures and zero mounted volumes/buckets. A docs-only `main` merge (#506) triggered a Railway deployment, which completed SUCCESS at 2026-10-10T20:56:15Z. Thus documentation merges may trigger staging deployments automatically; review deployment triggers before further merge cadence. Staging health is not full functional QA.
- Source-confirmed release risks: catalog and support image filesystem-only storage with no verified persistent mount; production `launch_ready` hard-blocked by five unconditional external evidence codes; FastPay production adapter pending; no hosted backup/PITR restore proof; Meta restricted-role page directory unresolved; some DB integration tests lack disposable-only URL guards. Detailed evidence and IDs live in `AUDIT_REGISTER.md`.
- Legacy support JSON routes are mounted after PostgreSQL support routes and a production fallback guard that returns HTTP 410 when operational PostgreSQL authority is required; HTTP behavior still needs safe negative tests.
- **Next exact actions:** (1) inspect current GitHub and Railway deploy SHA/status without touching secrets; (2) verify CI and current PR status; (3) prioritize a remediation acceptance matrix for persistent media, release-gate clearance, DB test safety and Meta RLS, requiring explicit authorization before application code or infrastructure edits; (4) run only verified disposable local tests, never against staging/production; (5) defer final visual QA and domain cutover until safety/functional gates pass.

## 2026-10-11 database test audit checkpoint

Current qualitative planning estimate is 70/100 (user's latest estimate, not a test-pass rate). PR #520 records read-only CI evidence and an eight-suite PostgreSQL safety sample. Three billing suites import the DB module before callback-only URL-presence checks; some delete test fixture rows before seeding. Separate support, historical cashier, and Meta ingress integration tests do contain early local disposable-DB guards. No test was executed. Next: inventory all test entrypoints and workflow runners; propose a shared pre-import guard and runner-level enforcement before any application code changes. Existing test safety findings remain open; do not duplicate IDs. Do not run database-writing tests on Neon staging or production.

## Backup workflow source verification

Verified `.github/workflows/backup-restore-drill.yml` on main. It defines a disposable PostgreSQL 16 service, separate local source/restore databases, backup manifest and checksum validation, restore with source/target consistency check, disposable object-storage restore comparison, and redacted evidence artifact. This proves a defined CI drill, not that it ran successfully in the current audit or that a hosted Neon/PITR or durable production media restore has been proven. Existing BACKUP-DRILL-001 remains open for hosted recovery evidence. No workflow executed or environment changed.
