## Staff mutation / scoped approver lock prepared — 2026-10-22

Candidate `44f46431c63e7ca723d4e1e283259a9872ab8abf` PENDING CI. Migration0042 introduces a fixed non-secret, private-scope-checked row-lock function so commerce can retain manager serialization after tenant staff mutation privileges are banned. No mutable-column exemption. Readiness requires safe function metadata/EXECUTE/unreachable owner and rejects all reachable staff table/column writes. Native actual-LOGIN mutation/grant/scope/real-lock/rollback and existing consume regressions prepared; previous2b4d154f46/46+78/78 remains accepted historical evidence. [Design/limits](P0-CASHIER-STAFF-LOCK-BOUNDARY-20261022.md). Initial583492a5 unit adapter mismatch caused3 failures; exact failure retained in evidence/P0-STAFF-LOCK-INITIAL-UNIT-ADAPTER-20261022.json. Correction recognizes new SQL/binds parameters/removes secret fixture fields without weakening business assertions. No new DB success claimed.

## Explicit owned-bootstrap fixture attestation — 2026-10-21

Published consumer correction `cb5eaa4eb4d92811d480eac7200062ed9a7407fc` is pending CI. Source review found that role-grant helpers re-attested process DATABASE_URL after it had correctly changed to tenant LOGIN.

**OPEN P0:** actual log still records successful `P0_TENANT_GUC_TRUST_PROOF` (raw tenant setting trusted; arbitrary SQL and foreign tenant identifier required; HTTP exploit not tested). Green CI must not be interpreted as exploit remediation. Remaining canonical central issuance/public predicate cutover, hosted identities/owners/ACL/pooler, auth/privacy/cashier integrity and provider/storage/retention gates remain uncertified. Historical85% is not a measured completion rate.

Containing fixture increment separates actual tenant/auth LOGINs for support and subscription reminders, Meta restore parent/child, and actual review-only LOGIN from primary checkout/auth in receipt review HTTP. Native bootstrap stays setup/inspection/cleanup only. Retains original fault/chronology/exactly-once/owner assertions. **New increment is PENDING CI**; four JS syntax checks and whitespace PASS.

## Active session identity readiness hardening — CI pending, 2026-10-15

Active Draft#550 / fix/p0-provider-receipt-order-discovery-20261015. Separate root cause: readiness checked current_user only; a privileged session_user can remain behind SET ROLE. New local unit reproduced7PASS/1FAIL (missing rejection), repaired8/0; TypeScript/diffPASS. New code separately checks session role superuser/BYPASSRLS/protected-table ownership. New disposable cases reject bootstrap-superuser session behind restricted current role, and independently test non-superuser session roles with BYPASSRLS or receipt-table ownership; RESET ROLE is observed to restore unsafe RLS state, all fixture DDL rolls back. Existing normal acceptance fixtures now set both current/session identities to the restricted role with SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION, preserving original ownership membership cases. Actual new SQL/CI NOT RUN until publication; do not count previous326PASS as this source's acceptance.

Next: inspect new CI/source, exact session-role SQL outcomes, fullrestore/cleanup and all workflows; record results. Resume git fetch origin fix/p0-provider-receipt-order-discovery-20261015; git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD. Owned runner only: bash scripts/run-isolated-postgres-audit.sh tenant.

## Current acceptance and handoff — 2026-10-15

Active Draft #550, branch `fix/p0-provider-receipt-order-discovery-20261015`, base Draft #549. Tested code commit: `cd7408ee178393a5a63a02e6bbdc9a163cd54c00`. All **25/25 observed workflows SUCCESS**. Isolated run `38681867802`, job `116247985222`, merge checkout `181b04e212b5c98e8848652e56d4f517b19464e5`: **324 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 SKIP**, 55 unique files / 57 invocations. Counts include parent tests and repeated runtimes; never add overlapping workflow totals.

The original signed SaaS/cashier callback now finds an existing mapped order under a nonowner, non-superuser, NOBYPASSRLS runtime with empty tenant/admin context. Independent SQL proves one immutable receipt, one application and one subscription for each authority; fresh duplicate replay retains original receipt/paid time. Naked global reads remain zero and pooled context resets. Permission denial, request/amount mismatch, same-authority and cross-authority ambiguity fail closed without grants. The capability only resolves existing authoritative orders; arbitrary ownership repair is not implemented. Operator authorization remains separate.

Baseline failure is preserved: source `1f3d743a78d7716b21b6e875e62e4fe477e324a4`, run `38681215276` / job `116245975903`, 321 PASS / 3 FAIL / 0 SKIP (parent plus two new cases). Both returned ORDER_NOT_FOUND despite mapped orders, with receipt1/apps0/grants0. Exact report: `P0_RESTRICTED_PROVIDER_ORDER_DISCOVERY_20261015.md`; baseline and repair JSON evidence under `evidence/P0_RESTRICTED_PROVIDER_DISCOVERY_*_20261015.json`.

Canonical regeneration/reproducibility and actual SQL PASS in schema run `38681868158`, job `116247986045`; this provides CI evidence despite the local symlinked-pnpm generator block. Full restore PASS: 34 migrations / 95 tables / 45 policies / 9 functions, matching seed/verify fingerprint `388515b2f9bd94c03cded652f5f39a5414fb1f6950f80f2521d033c237392035`. New resolver remains non-PUBLIC after restore. Owned container/volume cleanup PASS. Parent #549 cashier RLS readiness repair `36f955e` remains accepted (321/0/0, 14 workflows), now included in this source.

Remaining: provider-specific mapping changes after initial discovery and between receipt-admission commit/application are **NOT RUN**. Additional delegated instrumentation was interrupted by an automated content flag; incomplete unpublished changes were removed, so they are not part of this accepted source. Next exact unit is a controlled fixture concurrency proof at those actual database boundaries, with immutable receipt/no premature grant/context-reset assertions. Merchant mutation after admission is constrained by existing composite FKs; do not weaken them. Also independently review receipt/function-owner readiness coverage. Hosted owner/RLS/EXECUTE/provider acceptance, deployment gating/storage, arbitrary ownership repair and retention-duration/privileged-deletion policy remain OPEN. No new percentage is measured: historical85% complete/15% remaining only; release **NO-GO**.

No main merge, Railway deployment, hosted migration/grant/secret changes or real payment was performed or authorized. Documentation-only final checkpoint uses [skip ci]; tested code is the SHA above. No tests are running at this checkpoint.

Exact resume commands and remaining unit are in WORK_HANDOFF.

Default disposable role and mounted router fixtures; not deployed grants/full-app fallthrough/browser/live OTP/media durability proof. Owner Support device trust uses real services with synthetic setup; actual owner OTP/device login separately passed in admin suite.

Prior Support fixture failures remain documented: invalid legacy phone shape (23514), then device-less owner session (AUTH_POSTGRES_OWNER_DEVICE_REQUIRED), both before HTTP. Corrected only test fixtures, pre-mutation cleanup and audit counters; no app/schema change. Failed incomplete output was not counted as success. Final complete runtime above supersedes those prepared/setup-only statuses.

**Exact next SEQ-138:** mounted merchant/admin Support page state and role/browser coverage from the37route inventory (loading/empty/error/retry, allowed/denied role surfaces and keyboard/RTL), separating synthetic API UI proof from already verified real Support HTTP. Then remaining owner/admin/merchant screen groups. Reuse all completed service/media/report proofs; rerun only for changed code/config or a justified new assertion. No main merge, deployment, live DB/secrets or real payment.

Status: FA-000 in progress. Source of truth: GitHub `main` plus this audit ledger once merged.
Baseline commit: `56d7ac266d2d02d0cc5197f2dfeda134199b2baf` (2026-10-09).
Last recorded: 2026-10-10.

## Purpose
Close the existing Fawri engineering audit without repeating already proven work. Freeze feature scope. Visual QA is last. Production domain and external Meta/AI/billing integrations follow a separately approved release gate.

## Non-negotiable rules
1. Each task has an ID, scope, baseline SHA, evidence links, outcome, and exact next action.
2. A prior PASS is historical evidence, not automatic proof at a later commit. Reopen only for a relevant code/config change or reproducible new finding; record why.
3. Separate **implemented**, **tested**, **deployed**, and **verified end-to-end**. Do not equate one with another.
4. Audit read-only by default. No branch merges/deletions, DB writes, secrets changes, redeploys, or production actions without explicit authorization.
5. Before any new work read PROGRESS.md, AUDIT_REGISTER.md, ISSUES.md, and check current GitHub SHA. At end, record what was verified and where to resume.
6. Do not record credentials, tokens, personal data, database connection strings, or private logs.
7. PASS requires evidence and closure criteria; BLOCKED must name the missing proof. Do not invent completion percentages.

## Stages
- FA-000 Continuity system: create four audit files on a review branch, open PR, merge only after review/checks.
- FA-001 GitHub inventory: paginate all branches and PRs, classify merged/obsolete/diverged/unmerged; do not merge or delete automatically.
- FA-002 Delta and cross-system integration audit: inspect only changed or unproven paths; cashier offline, bot/order/inventory/subscription interactions, tenant isolation, and failures; evaluate concrete external findings.
- FA-003 Targeted fixes and cleanup: fix evidenced defects; run relevant regression gates; dictionary/AR/KU/EN review and structural cleanup only when justified.
- FA-004 Staging operational proof: Railway API/frontend, Neon PostgreSQL role/migrations, readiness, backups and service workflows. No production DB mutations.
- FA-005 Final visual QA: merchant, cashier, owner admin, AR/KU/EN, responsive and accessibility; last.
- FA-006 Final release decision: one verified main SHA, gate report, documented external-provider blockers, controlled domain/integration plan.

## Current continuation — SEQ-113 (2026-10-12)

Baseline23563ffb, main d38d2922; continue fromSEQ114, not from initialFA000/SEQ26. PR520 discussion carriesSEQ27–108; latest durable canonical additions coverSEQ109–113.

SeeWORK_HANDOFF for exact continuation and commands. No authorization for business fixes, merge or deploy.


## SEQ-114 — guarded real PostgreSQL proof prepared (2026-10-12)

Continuation from saved commit `3d88d9c78350db1b82036eee6e2a0a6c73c75ba6`. Added test-only `artifacts/api-server/tests/cashier-sync-multidevice-postgres.integration.test.mjs` and registered it first in the existing `cashier` isolated runner batch. No application changes or workflow permissions altered.

Two subtests plus parent: four independent merchant trials, two licensed/credentialed devices competing simultaneously for one physical stock unit at one location; require exactly one sale, one mutation, one timeline record, stock0/version2 and loser CASHIER_SYNC_NEGATIVE_STOCK. Concurrent exact winner replays must cause no second mutation; changed-note replay must reject idempotency conflict; loser retry must remain negative-stock. Separate actual-SQL timeline observation accepts1→3 and rejects later2, preserving the sequence-gap PROOF_GAP instead of approving that behavior. No provider HTTP: subscription activation uses existing test_fake APIs and all fixtures are synthetic.

Shared attestation executes before DB/application imports; teardown registered before first fixture mutation, tracks owned account IDs before INSERT and aggregates cleanup failures. Existing network-none runner and migrated schema retained. Local syntax checks PASS; direct unattested invocation exits1 with expected guard refusal before DB import. Actual PostgreSQL assertions **NOT_RUN locally / CI_PENDING**, no assertion success claimed. Expected inventory becomes36 unique files/38 invocations for the full isolated run if all existing phases execute; counts/results must come from logs, not expectation.

Exact next action: inspect the new commit's isolated CI cashier phase and this test's AUDIT_SUITE_RESULT, distinguish fixture/schema errors from product failures, verify cleanup, and update these ledgers. Do not rerun previous unchanged assertions merely to increase counts; this run is justified by new multi-device/altered-replay/gap assertions. After proof, continue SEQ-115 feasible expired/admin-closed historical shift recovery. Browser/IndexedDB remain blocked locally by missing Chromium. Functional fixes, hosted DB, deploy and merge remain unapproved. SEQ-114 is PREPARED until actual results are reconciled.


## SEQ-114a / SEQ-115 continuation

## Current exact resume checkpoint

SEQ-109–114 bounded audit completed with final executed source0d5b9ef8; SEQ-115 lifecycle source review completed, runtime recovery still OPEN. Read final EXECUTION_RESULTS/ISSUES/WORK_HANDOFF instead of earlier pending fixture notes. Final SQL/HTTP135PASS/21FAIL/0SKIP; no application fixes or launch certification. NextSEQ-116: feasible staff disable/re-enable or administrative shift closure with pending historical operation, and browser prerequisites for IndexedDB versionchange/replay/offline tests. Billing repair requires explicit approval of the concrete preserved proposal; do not merge/deploy/live-mutate.


## SEQ-116 — closed-shift recovery HTTP proof prepared, 2026-10-12

Continuation baseline `57032ce1a88d0ee1588b401fd714668485bb9952`, same audit branch/PR520. User clarified: complete comprehensive audit first; defer all application repair planning/execution until the audit is complete. Earlier billing implementation approval question is withdrawn; no approval requested. No restart of verified stages.

Added `artifacts/api-server/tests/cashier-closed-shift-recovery-http-postgres.integration.test.mjs` to existing guarded cashier runner. Synthetic disposable schema only: real HTTP PIN login, timestamp inside original session, real administrative staff-service disable/re-enable closing original shift, revoked-token rejection/no sale, fresh PIN login/new shift, wrong-device denial, old-operation HTTP upload with original staff/shift/session attribution, complete entity ACK and exact replay/no duplicate stock/order/attribution. Owner administration HTTP middleware, browser outbox, returns/voids and other-staff/tenant cases are outside this bounded new proof. Shared attestation executes before DB/application imports; aggregate HTTP/account/pool cleanup registered before mutation.

Local `node --check` PASS; direct invocation without attestation refuses (exit1) before DB imports as required. SQL/HTTP assertions **PREPARED / NOT_RUN** until isolated Actions logs are read. CI head baseline57032ce1 has23 completed workflows:21SUCCESS/2FAIL (isolated audit/cashier); prior source0d5b9ef8 results135PASS/21FAIL reused, not rerun evidence. New test adds one invocation, expected inventory37 unique/39 invocations, subject to actual logs. CASHIER-SYNC-SHIFT-001 remainsOPEN awaiting results; no new functional bug declared.

Next: read isolated cashier suite result/cleanup, classify fixture vs product failure; continue SEQ117 native IndexedDB versionchange/concurrency/changed-input replay. Existing browser-storage workflow only scans source and executes Node audit behavior; it does not launch a browser. Local Chromium/Docker/psql absent. Whole audit estimate unchanged~50% (40–60% uncertainty); source/runtime/browser/provider/hosted evidence remains separate.

The overall isolated and cashier workflows remain FAILURE because canonical product defects remain; green new tests do not override them.

**Print fixture failures correctly classified and resolved:** missing actual chart imports, missing original print-root wrapper, browser descendant/profile cleanup, and omitted UTF-8 declaration. Corrected harness retains actual chart/PDF/metric assertions, owns browser group and removes profile before result. Source app index.html/cashier.html already declare UTF-8. Local `node --test scripts/fawri-report-print-fixture.test.mjs`2PASS reproduces wrong decoding of raw Arabic regex (blank monetary number) and correct original UTF-8 output; corrected real browser3PASS confirms fixture diagnosis.

All repairs and consolidated repair plan remain deferred until comprehensive audit completion.

**Definitive next SEQ-128:** bounded central-cashier report/receipt print and profit-visibility scope, separating genuine app role/PDF evidence from inert adapters. Then unverified owner/admin/merchant screen groups from the37route inventory. Reuse completed sync/compensation/workbook/date proofs; reopen only for changed code/config or a new justified assertion. No merge/deploy/live DB/secrets/real payments authorized.
